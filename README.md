# VersionReleaser

# BEFORE READING!

this is for UNITY ONLY! also MAKE SURE TO EDIT THE REPO AFTER FORKING! THIS IS ALSO USED BY ME PERSONALLY SOOOOOO.












### Version Releaser! Why make a launcher when this is a thing?

with this auto updater you can easily make a auto updater to automatically update your unity games!

### How do I use it?

Simple! Fork the repo edit version.txt with your current version create a empty gameobject and plob the script in! (and you will have to change the links for the repo if you fork it) ALSO make sure to release it as a zip or else it wont work!



## Common issues ⁉️

"It downloaded a random file!" you probably forgot to change the links for the repo

"It didn't update???" You have to release it as a zip
